# It’s Time To Reclaim The Inherent Value Of Authentic Ideas.
## How Many Times Have We Heard “Ideas Are Worthless, Execution Is Everything”?

First off. Ideas are not worthless.

## Ideas Are Valuable.

I’ll never understand why people underrate ideas so much. Here’s an idea: *ideas are being discriminated against*.

Daily. Ideas are being hated on. Mercilessly. You’ve heard it before, don’t lie: “Ideas Are Worthless”.

Honestly, I just don’t buy it. I don’t. And I don’t think any of us is buying that anymore.

Think about TED talks. The entire point of TED is to “spread ideas”. It’s not like you will gain anything else in an 18-minute talk. All you get is ideas. That’s all you get. Yet millions of people tune in to the next TED talk and join the next TEDx event like no tomorrow. Well, if ideas are that worthless, wouldn’t TED’s mission be worthless too? Should they be more authentic and change their message to “spreading worthlessness”?

I don’t think so.

What about Snapchat? Simple idea. Time-sensitive content. They literally added another dimension to content. They are going to take over the Internet in a few years. Facebook and Instagram will pale in comparison one day. Just a simple idea.

I could go on and on. Think about the idea of selling small apps on smartphones — the App Store idea. What a simple idea. Or how about restricting messages to 140 characters. Seriously. What an idea!

Now, I know what some of you will say. Ideas are still worthless without execution. Without strategy. Without hard work. Ok then, let’s dig deeper.

## Behind All Great Decisions There Is At Least One Great Idea.

Alright. Here’s another idea: *ideas are what execution is made of*.

Think about that for a minute.

We can map out the precise activity of executing a strategy into a series of key decisions. Execution is all about decision making. Great decisions yield great results. And bad decisions usually result in horrible execution. But behind every great decision you will always find one or more great ideas. They don’t have to be revolutionary. Just great.

You can trace great decisions to one or more moments in time when someone says something and someone else exclaims: “that’s a great idea!” When someone says “ideas are worthless” what they really mean is that the original idea for a business is not valuable in and of itself. A lot of smart people had the idea of creating a smartphone but the idea itself is of no remarkable value — instead, it’s the execution that matters. You can’t take the idea to the bank. So then, how do you actually turn the idea into a valuable product, right? That’s the billion dollar question.

Execution, of course.

So when you look at it that way, execution certainly trumps the original idea. Does that mean ideas are indeed worthless?

No. Not even close.

Let me explain. Let’s explore what it is that we mean by “execution”? What is execution made of? It’s made of people, time and resources.

1. People.
2. Time.
3. Resources.

There’s nothing else really, except people, time and resources. If you think people and time constitute resources, I would certainly debate you until we both run out of steam, but trust me on this one. People are not resources. Things are resources. People are resourceful, but not resources. And time is not a variable. We can’t produce more time and we can’t buy more time. Time is a constant. The Great Constant that unites us all and is as merciless or merciful on a high-ranking executive as on a fresh college graduate. We can’t use time as a differentiator.

You see, RIM had people, they had time and they had resources. But Apple destroyed them at the smartphone game. Nokia had people, time and resources too. And they were at the peak of their mobile game in 2007. What happened? Why did Apple execute so much better than established mobile giants back then? What did they do differently?

Now, did Nokia not hire intelligent people. Of course they did. Sure, Steve Jobs is Steve Jobs but still, all those other companies had highly intelligent people. Facebook offered to buy Snapchat for $3B a year or so after Snapchat barely even launched. Now, don’t tell me Facebook shuns hard work. Don’t tell me Facebook doesn’t have what it takes to execute. Don’t tell me Facebook doesn’t have intelligent people. Sure it does.

The difference is and always will be in how the people in each organization make decisions. And perhaps more importantly, how they were allowed to make decisions. Isn’t that so?

## Ideas Fuel Decisions And Decisions Fuel Execution.

Decisions are key moments in time when an idea is accepted as valuable and applied to the current strategy under-development. There can be no intelligent decisions without intelligent ideas to fuel those decisions.

Making decisions is hard because getting ideas is hard. Getting ideas is literally beyond our conscious control.

Don’t believe me?

Alright. Go ahead and get an ideas. Get one. Right now.

You see? Idea generation is not a science. It’s not predictable. It’s not measurable. Until we fully understand how the brain works, we can’t hope to understand how ideas work. And that’s precisely why they are valuable. That’s why companies that lost their idea generation mojo are desperately trying to stay market relevant.

An idea is like a tiny seed. Without the right context, timing, care, nutrition and environment, it will die. Sometimes before even breaking through the ground. It will just stay there, buried in the ground, joining billions of other dead seeds that no one will ever know. Ideas need a lot of care. They need the right climate to grow.

So how do you create the right climate for ideas to thrive?

Great question. To answer that, let’s actually peek inside the mysterious inner-workings of the brain.

## Tapping Into Your Fluid Intelligence.

What is thinking made up of really? Reasoning is a good candidate for describing the thinking process. But even reasoning is multi-flavored. Cattell’s theory of a dual phychometric for general intelligence (G) is widely accepted today. I’m hinting here at Fluid (Gf) vs Crystallized (Gc) reasoning. See, Crystallized reasoning utilizes our Crystallized Intelligence and it consists of performing old data fetches from our long-term memory. Meaning, it’s using our previously acquired knowledge. This knowledge is as great as our life experiences and it expands as we learn more. Most of the school systems out there focus extensively on building Crystallized Intelligence by throwing massive amounts of information at their students. The more you memorize, the more you can regurgitate come exam-time and the higher you score.

The problem comes when you are placed in a novel experience, one you don’t have any previously stored knowledge for. That’s when Crystallized Intelligence fails miserably. The brain tries to scan its long-term memory store in vain. It can’t find any dots it can connect. That’s why many educated people make bad decisions in novel situations.

*You Have To Tap Into Your Fluid Intelligence To Connect The Dots.*

On the other hand, Fluid Intelligence utilizes different parts of the brain and it acts very differently overall. It does not use long-term memory but it mainly works with our working memory. Historically, research has established that we can only store about 7 items in our working memory. Meaning, it’s very limited. It also means it’s volatile. If we wanted to make an analogy to how computers work we could draw some parallels between working memory and RAM and long term memory and hard disks. The research on fluid intelligence so far is still young but we know enough to draw some conclusions with real, practical implications.

For instance, Fluid Reasoning is where the brain chews on ideas so to speak. It is in the active usage of our working memory in ideation sessions, or if you want to crudely call them brainstorming sessions, so be it. No matter what we call them, those highly creative sessions of idea exchange is where we flex our working memory muscle and exercise our fluid intelligence. And it is precisely in these highly intensive ideation sessions where ideas are born, killed, transformed, and grown. And the outcome?

One word: Strategy.

Or, if you want — execution. Sure. The bottom line is that effective execution requires a different kind of intelligence than the one we’re taught in school A different type of way of thinking. It requires Fluid Intelligence. When we tap into our Fluid Intelligence, our brain enters into a creative state that is free of artificial constraints. Some refer to this state as being “in the zone”. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls “Flow”. Whatever you want to call it, your Fluid Intelligence is responsible for opening the door to that state of mind. Once there, incredible things can happen. Ideas simply flow. Maybe that’s where Csikszentmihalyi got his name from.

## Well-Executed Winning Strategies Are Made Of Winning Ideas.

And here the crux of the “ideas are worthless” problem. If ideas are worthless, then Flow is a state we want to stay away from. Don’t we? I mean, why would we seek a state of mind where we would spend our precious time generating worthlessness?

On the other hand, if ideas are valuable in and of themselves — and they are — then seeking Flow would be the smartest thing we could possible do if success is something we truly care about. It’s in that highly creative state where ideas literally flow effortlessly, that we make our best decisions and craft the best strategies.

*Just As The Best Ideas Flow From Fluid Minds, So Do The Best Strategies Flow From Fluid Ideas.*

The bottom line is that we can’t execute without ideas because the act of executing in itself is fundamentally dependent on ideas. The ones that don’t get it, will continue acquire knowledge and technology, thus investing in their overall Corporate Crystallized Intelligence. On the other hand, the companies do get it, invest in creating the climate necessary to nurture and grow creativity and thus set their best people up for success by nudging them daily in that highly creative state of Flow, where they get to use the best part of their brain, their Fluid Intelligence.

Here’s to lots of valuable, Fluid Ideas and lots of winning strategies. Make it happen and do your part to reclaim the inherent value of ideas! For example you could like and share this article :)
