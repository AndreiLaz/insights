# The Coming Age Of The Disappearing Infrastructure

## But Not To Worry Fellow Shell-Geeks, The Future Is Bright

I’m a shell-geek. I’ve always been. My first real job back in 2001 was managing a high-availability network made up of quite a few Unix and Linux machines. And that meant living in the shell. Korn shell, Bash shell, whatever shell, I would always go back to my shell and let my inner geek go crazy at the prompt. Some 15 years later, I’m still a shell-geek.

The shell is not going anywhere, but the way we use it is about to change radically.

To understand why, a bit of history.

## Beyond The PC Era And Into The Era Of Calm Technology

Around that same time, 2001, I started working on my first real company. It was called Calm Technologies. I had created my first real product, a client-server mobile file browser. You would install the server on your home computer and then you could browser your files from your mobile phone. Needless to say, I had no idea what product management, marketing and so forth meant and so the product went nowhere. Ditto for the company.

As most entrepreneurs say at the end of a failure, it was a learning experience. But honestly, it truly was. Perhaps, the greatest learning experience for me, wasn’t so much the fact that I tried to grow a product company, but it was that I had learned about a new way of thinking about products. I had recently discovered the work of a brilliant man named Mark Weiser. His research while at Xerox PARC has changed the way I understood technology. I recommend two of his papers in particular, [The Coming Age Of Calm Technology](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/acmfuture2endnote.htm) and [The Computer For The 21st Century](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf).

Guess where I got the name of my first company from?

It’s no mystery that most of the PC era was influenced heavily by innovations pioneered by Apple and Microsoft. But perhaps what’s somewhat less known is that most of the innovations championed by Apple, Microsoft and the like, originated at Xerox PARC. The researchers there made history and will remain heroes in the eyes of many tech entrepreneurs. One such hero is Mark Weiser.

He proposed the idea that technology has three major eras. The Mainframe era, The Personal Computing Era and The Ubiquitous Computing Era. We’re way into the Ubiquitous (or Pervasive) Computing era today. But we still have so much to learn from the work of giants like the researchers at Xerox PARC did decades ago. There’s so much to learn, but I just want to pick out a powerful idea and use it to better understand the current forces that are shaping our present. And our future. The first sentence of the [The Computer For The 21st Century](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf) reads as follows:

*The Most Profound Technologies Are Those That Dissappear.*
