# The Coming Age Of The Disappearing Infrastructure

## But Not To Worry Fellow Shell-Geeks, The Future Is Bright

I’m a shell-geek. I’ve always been. My first real job back in 2001 was managing a high-availability network made up of quite a few Unix and Linux machines. And that meant living in the shell. Korn shell, Bash shell, whatever shell, I would always go back to my shell and let my inner geek go crazy at the prompt. Some 15 years later, I’m still a shell-geek.

The shell is not going anywhere, but the way we use it is about to change radically.

To understand why, a bit of history.

## Beyond The PC Era And Into The Era Of Calm Technology

Around that same time, 2001, I started working on my first real company. It was called Calm Technologies. I had created my first real product, a client-server mobile file browser. You would install the server on your home computer and then you could browser your files from your mobile phone. Needless to say, I had no idea what product management, marketing and so forth meant and so the product went nowhere. Ditto for the company.

As most entrepreneurs say at the end of a failure, it was a learning experience. But honestly, it truly was. Perhaps, the greatest learning experience for me, wasn’t so much the fact that I tried to grow a product company, but it was that I had learned about a new way of thinking about products. I had recently discovered the work of a brilliant man named Mark Weiser. His research while at Xerox PARC has changed the way I understood technology. I recommend two of his papers in particular, [The Coming Age Of Calm Technology](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/acmfuture2endnote.htm) and [The Computer For The 21st Century](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf).
