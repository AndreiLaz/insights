# The Coming Age Of The Disappearing Infrastructure

## But Not To Worry Fellow Shell-Geeks, The Future Is Bright

I’m a shell-geek. I’ve always been. My first real job back in 2001 was managing a high-availability network made up of quite a few Unix and Linux machines. And that meant living in the shell. Korn shell, Bash shell, whatever shell, I would always go back to my shell and let my inner geek go crazy at the prompt. Some 15 years later, I’m still a shell-geek.

The shell is not going anywhere, but the way we use it is about to change radically.

To understand why, a bit of history.
