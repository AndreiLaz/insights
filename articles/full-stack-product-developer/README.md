# The Full Stack Product Developer Job Description That Never Was
## Live Up To This Job Description And You Will Attract The Best Developers In Town. Guaranteed.
A few years ago I had built a superstar Full Stack Product Development Team. Perhaps built is the wrong word. Handcrafted. That’s more like it. I had carefully handcrafted a small team of people on fire who collectively created and launched seven products in twelve months.

Here’s a funny story.

I was growing the team and I was actively looking for another superstar to join. I was asked by HR to create a job description for the person I was looking for.

I did.

Unfortunately, that job description never really made it out the door. I had eventually found my guy, without a job description. As usual. But nonetheless, I thought it was funny that the job description never went out. I was to told that there is no such role out there. There are Java Developers. There are .NET developers. Perl Developers. PHP Developers. JavaScript developers. Angular Developers. Maybe even React Developers. There are Linux Administrators. There are Graphic Designers. There are User Experience Designers. There are Sales and Marketing Specialists. There are Support Engineers. Magento Developers. Wordpress Developers. Drupal Developers.

Phew. I know. The list goes on.

Why couldn’t I ask for one of those developers? Right?

Well, I wanted one that could do it all. Or as much as possible. Is that too much to ask for?

I was told it is.

Nonetheless. Just for fun. Here’s a slightly updated version of the Full Stack Product Developer Job Description that never went out. I’d be happy for you to use it or hack it and update it. Just live up to it. If you can.

## Skills & Requirements

Our development philosophy goes back to the heart and spirit of the Agile Manifesto but we don’t consider ourselves an agile team. We don’t practice Scrum and we don’t do agile estimates, whatever those are. We do however deliver software on time; we do exceed the expectations of our stakeholders and our user community; we have a wealth of exciting new features lined-up in the roadmap; we use a gigantic whiteboard and we brainstorm a lot; we work hard and we play hard; we actually love showing up to work and doing what we do best every day. You could call us agile but then we’d have to fire you on the spot and we didn’t even hire you. Yet.
