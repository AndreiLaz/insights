# The End Of IT Outsourcing (As We Know It)
## Are You Ready To Make The Shift?

There is a time and place for everything. But like all finite things in life, all good things come to an end eventually. Take the agrarian era. For all we know, people must’ve thought the horse and carriage were it in terms of transportation. The horse was it for hundreds of years.

Until it wasn’t **it** anymore.

As the world transformed through the Industrial Revolution and manufacturing became the norm, transportation evolved and just about every other industry with it.

We’re way beyond the Post-Industrial Era today and we’re in the midst of the transformation of our generation. The Internet has evolved like nothing before its time and with it, it has transformed everything. Literally everything.

Countries like India and Romania have been transformed by a new Industry that was born less than 2 decades ago: **the IT industry**. Take Romania for instance. There are hundreds of software companies in Cluj alone, the city I live in. I look around and see growth. And IT professionals having the time of their life.

*But I also see a speeding freight train heading straight for Cluj and beyond.*

And it ain’t carrying potatoes.

Let me put it this way. The outsourcing business model is about to be completely disrupted. One only needs to look at India for hints for what’s to come. Or even giants like Accenture. On all counts, all over the globe, outsourcing is getting ready to say goodbye to the 21st century.

Why?

One word: cloud.

That’s it. Nothing fancy. Nothing complicated. Just the cloud. Well, and a few other reasons but they all revolve around the cloud so yeah — the cloud.

What does that mean for places like Cluj?

That means we need to adapt. We need to see the train heading straight for us and get outta the way. Ie. **move**! We have to start moving in new directions in order to withstand the storm.

What new directions?

Here’s a few:

* Managed Services
* Productized Services
* Automation Consulting
* Product Development
* Product Management
* Innovation Management

For regions were staff augmentation is still **it**, changing direction will require a radical transformation. To make it alive through to the other side, an outsourcing company will need to shift from a factory & manufacturing model to a studio & craftsmanship model.

But turning a cost center into a value center won’t happen over night. The three fundamental areas that will need to be radically transformed are **Business, Technology** and **Culture.**

And that last one, culture, is the silent killer. Well, maybe not so silent.

The next 3–5 years will be interesting to watch, that’s for sure.

What do you guys think? Can places like Cluj make the transition?
