# All Products That Made History Have One Thing In Common.
## And You Definitely Need To Add It To Your Product Roadmap.

List your top 10 favorite products.

Can you pick out that X-Factor that they all share in common? Why did you pick those over the other thousands of products out thereI’d love to see your top 10 list. But what I would really love to hear is what you think

All great products have certain qualities that sets them apart. Beauty is really hard to get right for example. And so is simplicity. If you get at least one of those right I personally guarantee you will get far enough.

But above beauty, above simplicity and above everything else I believe great products share this in common:

*They Are Like A Time Machine.*

That’s right. Let me explain.

But first, why do we even use products in the first place? We use products because we want our lives to be better. We all want a better life. Who doesn’t?

A good product is one that makes today feel like tomorrow.

A good product is one that flies you through time somehow and unveils a better life ahead of you. Not only that, but it gives you that life. Now. In a sense, a good product grants you your wishes. And it grants them to you sooner than you’d expect.

A good product is one that grants you — today — that long awaited life-changing experience that you live and re-live in your wishful dreams.

A Time Machine. Just hope on and fly through time to a better tomorrow. Today.

Make your product feel like a time machine to your customers. Just do it.
