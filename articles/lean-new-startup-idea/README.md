Hacker: Hi Lean, I have an idea for a new startup.

Lean: Who cares. Ideas are meaningless. They’re worth … I dunno %1 maybe? Maybe … the rest is all sweat and tears and blood and rotten … I meant the rest is all execution you naive little …

Hacker: But wait you haven’t even heard my idea yet.

Lean: Who cares? It’s all an illusion right now. You have to first prove yourself by validating your idea and by sacrificing your stupid little dreams to Lean.

Hacker: Lean, who are you really?

Lean: Oh no you didn’t. You young impertinent arrogant-wanna-be-world-changer. Lean is the ultimate tyrant — uhm — I mean ruler — or do I mean dictator… Listen. You need Lean ok. Don’t ask stupid questions.

Hacker: Why though? Why do I need Lean?

Lean: Think of Lean as a well thought-out belief system that requires you to give up your dreams and forces you to embrace other people’s dreams otherwise you are a failure. But failure is good. And don’t ask why. But asking questions is good. You have to get out of the building and ask questions.

Hacker: But a minute ago you said I shouldn’t ask anything.

Lean: Exactly.

Lean: Sorry, I’m utterly confused.

Hacker: Exactly. You need Lean. It will unconfuse you.

Hacker: I don’t think that’s a real word.

Lean: See that’s your problem. You’re not open minded enough.

Hacker: I think my idea is pretty good though. I think I figured out a way to solve a difficult problem for a lot of people.

Lean: You don’t get it do you? Alright. How many people is a lot?

Hacker: I don’t know, maybe a million or two. Maybe more. I’m not sure.

Lean: Ha. You just made me spill my 3rd wave coffee. How will you ever become a unicorn with a mere 7 digit market?

Hacker: A unicorn?

Lean: You really need a primer in everything don’t you? Yeah. A unicorn. The one and only purpose of a Lean Startup. The Lean meaning in startup life. The only dream that matters. A billion dollar valuation.

Hacker: Ah I see. But I don’t really care much for money. I just want to use my gifts to solve real problems and make the world a better place.

Lean: Oh my Leanness. What … I can’t even … you are so lost I can’t even see you anymore. Hey little naive dreamer, where are you? I can’t see you anymore.

Hacker: What…?

Lean: Don’t you understand that money is everything? Money. Money. Money. E-V-A-T-R-I-N-G!

Hacker: I don’t think that’s how you spell …

Lean: Don’t think. Don’t. Just listen. The only metric that Lean cares about is Revenue. Capish? What are you? Stupid? Eh? Revenue, alright? That’s a nice fancy word for money. But yeah, revenue. You don’t got it. You don’t exist. How will you ever go and make other naive startup kiddies like yourself jealous if you have no money? Huh? How? Well technically you could go raise money and have nothing to show for but even then, even then, you can pretend that’s revenue. See? Money trumps all.

Hacker: I see. So what should I do now? I mean, I’ve spent the last 4 months hacking at a product in my spare time …

Lean: You did what? Oh my flavored coffee! Why? Why would you do such a thing?

Hacker: Because I wanted to see my dream become reality? And I rather spend my leisure time coding rather than waste it online.

Lean: How much wrong! Oh how much wrong! Online is where you need to be, not building real stuff. You should be online talking about building stuff instead of actually building it. That way you make sure you don’t build the wrong product. Duh!

Hacker: But who gets to say it’s wrong? A lot of products started out as side projects. Like Google or Facebook for example. Or even Basecamp.

Lean: You have no idea of the inner workings of those founders minds. Their vision was 40–20 from the get-go. Their predictions of the future were as accurate and sharp as a baby unicorn’s … uhm… corn. Yeah.

Hacker: You mean they had vision?

Lean: No, I told you vision is evil. No vision. Say no to vision kids.

Hacker: But you just said…

Lean: What I meant is that Lean told them what to do?

Hacker: I though the Lean Startup did not exist back then.

Lean: Ok seriously you’re wasting my time.

Hacker: I apologize. Should I abandon my product then?

Lean: Yes abandon it. And get out of the building.

Hacker: What building?

Lean: The building.

Hacker: I don’t think …

Lean: Stop thinking. Lean doesn’t like that. Lean says “ask questions”. So stop thinking. Just talk. Customers don’t care about your vision. Just talk to them.

Hacker: But you said no questions … Anyways, so I should stop hacking then?

Lean: Yes stop it.

Hacker: But I was so close…

Lean: Close to what? To your vision? See? No one cares. Do you see anyone caring? Nope. No one. Stop hacking. Stop coding. Stop designing. Stop making. Stop creating. Stop building. Stop generating value. It’s all meaningless without the approval of Lean.

Hacker: Ok. I understand. I will do that than. Thank you. I believe in Lean now. I feel so much better. Lean is good. Ideas bad. Building bad. Out of the building good. Vision bad. Other people’s opinion of my dream good. I understand now. Thank you so much.

Lean: Lean approves.

Ex-Hacker: To think I spent 4 full months working on an illusion. I am so glad I am free now. I can finally stop building … inside the building … and I can finally get out … of the building … phase. That’s what it was. Just a phase. I am so glad I am now free. My own ideas were such a burden. I never thought not thinking for myself would feel so good. Thank you Lean. Thank you.

Lean: See? Doesn’t this feel better.

Ex-Hacker: Oh yes. Yes it does. It feels so much better. Thank you Lean. Oh, Lean?

Lean: Yes?

Ex-Hacker: One last thing.

Lean: Sure. What is it?

Ex-Hacker: Before I abandon the code and move on, can I just use it one last time?

Lean: Use it? You mean it actually worked?

Ex-Hacker: Oh yeah. Sure. But it doesn’t matter now. I now see how meaningless that was.

Lean: Sure I guess. Go ahead. What does it actually do?

Ex-Hacker: Oh nothing. It’s just a very rudimentary time machine. I just want to go back 4 months ago and stop myself from wasting my time building it so I can be free to get out of the building. Then I will feel truly free and I can dedicate the rest of my life to you, Lean.

Thank you Lean.
