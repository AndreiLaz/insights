# Corporate Gut Check Time: Be Honest, You Don’t Want The Best People To Work For You
Ok. Here we go. Corporate Gut Check Time.

Why in the world would companies want The Best People to work for them? Think about it.

1. The Best People have too many disruptive ideas.
2. The Best People poke holes in your strategy faster than you can say “we do Agile”.
3. The Best People shine the light of reason on your roadmap and make you question everything.
4. The Best People inspire your other employees to start asking more challenging questions.
5. The Best People challenge you way too often.
6. The Best People make you work way to hard just to remain relevant.
7. The Best People pull you out of your comfort zone more often than you’re used to.
8. The Best People are right more often than you’d like them to be.
9. The Best People are too good at what they do and they make everyone feel uncomfortable.

Seriously, be honest. You don’t want The Best People to work for you.

Otherwise, you’d have to change. And you’d rather give up on the The Best People than change.

Be honest.
